# Memory Usage: 16.3 MB, less than 6.56% of Python3 online submissions for Single Number.

# Time complexity : O(n * 1) = O(n)O(nâ‹…1)=O(n). Time complexity of for loop is O(n)O(n). Time complexity of hash table(dictionary in python) operation pop is O(1)O(1).

# Space complexity : O(n)O(n). The space required by hash_table is equal to the number of elements in nums.

# Time complexity : O(n)O(n). We only iterate through nums, so the time complexity is the number of elements in nums.

# Space complexity : O(1)O(1).
